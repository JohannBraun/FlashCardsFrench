# FlashCardsFrench

This project was created as part of an online python learning course.

The program shows a word in french and after a few seconds automatically flips to it's translation into english. 
The user can then confirm if he knew the word by clicking on the green checkmark, thus deleting it from the pool of words he has to learn. It will not show up again in the list of words.
If on the other hand the X is pressed, it means that the translation was not known and the word stays in the list of unknown words.

python concepts in this project: 
- pandas 
- basic UI using tkinter 
- error handling
- reading/writing files
